# CSCI 3212 Final Paper Trial 1 Data

This repo contains data from Trial 1 of my CSCI 3212 final paper. See the paper for more info on the methodology.

Full-text excerpts of the conversations can be found in the `conversations` directory. They follow the structure below:

- `company-topic-00/`: name of the conversation
  - `00-prompt.txt`: prompt provided by the user
  - `00-response.txt`: response generated by the model
  - `00-artifact-00.*`: optional non-text "artifacts" generated by the model

Each numbered prompt corresponds to one response with the same number and any number of optional artifacts.

Conversations labeled `openai` are with OpenAi's ChatGPT-5.1, `anthropic` are with Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5, and `google` are with Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash.
