Sure! Here is a clear example of how **DFS traverses a graph**, including:

1. A simple example graph
2. A visual representation
3. The exact DFS visit order (recursive DFS)

# ��️ Example Graph

Let’s build a graph with **7 nodes (0–6)**.

### **Adjacency List**

```
0: 1, 2
1: 3, 4
2: 5
3: 6
4: (none)
5: (none)
6: (none)
```

---

# �� Visual Representation

```
        0
       / \
      1   2
     / \   \
    3   4   5
    |
    6
```

# �� DFS Traversal (Starting from Node 0)

Using recursive DFS, we follow the rule:

> “Go as deep as possible before backtracking.”

### Step-by-step visit sequence:

1. Start at **0**
2. Go to **1**
3. Go to **3**
4. Go to **6**

   * 6 has no unvisited neighbors → backtrack to 3
5. Back to **1**, visit **4**
6. Backtrack to **0**
7. Visit **2**
8. Visit **5**

# ✅ Final DFS Visit Order

```
0 → 1 → 3 → 6 → 4 → 2 → 5
```

# �� If you'd like…

I can also generate:

* The **iterative DFS traversal order**
* A DFS **tree** explicitly showing parent/child relationships
* A version where you choose the graph
* A visualization with colors / step numbers
* Code that prints the DFS order

Just tell me what you'd like to see next!
