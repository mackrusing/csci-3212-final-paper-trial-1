Perfect! I've created an interactive visualization that shows exactly how DFS traverses through a graph. 

**Key things to observe as you step through:**

1. **Stack Behavior (LIFO)**: Notice how DFS uses a stack that operates on Last In, First Out principle. The most recently added node is always processed first.

2. **Depth-First Pattern**: Watch how the algorithm goes as deep as possible down one branch (0 → 1 → 3, then backtracks to explore 1 → 4 → 7) before moving to other branches.

3. **Visit Order**: The final traversal order will be something like: **0 → 1 → 3 → 4 → 7 → 2 → 5 → 6 → 8**

This demonstrates the "go deep first" nature of DFS - it exhaustively explores one path before backtracking to try another path.

**Compare this mentally to BFS** (which would visit: 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8, exploring level by level). DFS dives deep, while BFS spreads wide!

Click "Play" to watch the animation, or use "Next" to step through at your own pace. Notice how the stack grows and shrinks as we explore deeper and backtrack.
