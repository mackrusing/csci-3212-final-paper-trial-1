I've created a complete Java implementation of the Depth-First Search algorithm! This implementation includes:

**Core DFS Methods:**
- `dfsRecursive()` - Classic recursive DFS traversal
- `dfsIterative()` - Iterative DFS using an explicit stack

**Practical Applications:**
- `findPath()` - Find a path between two nodes using DFS
- `hasCycle()` - Detect if the graph contains a cycle
- `countConnectedComponents()` - Count disconnected components in the graph
- `nodesAtDepth()` - Find all nodes at a specific depth from a start node

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Adjacency List Representation**: The graph uses an array of LinkedLists for efficient neighbor access
2. **Visited Tracking**: Boolean arrays prevent revisiting nodes
3. **Backtracking**: The path-finding method demonstrates backtracking by removing nodes when dead ends are reached
4. **Cycle Detection**: Uses parent tracking to distinguish back edges from tree edges

The main method includes comprehensive examples showing all the different DFS operations in action. You can run this code directly to see how DFS explores the graph depth-first, always going as deep as possible before backtracking!

Would you like me to explain any specific part of the implementation in more detail?
